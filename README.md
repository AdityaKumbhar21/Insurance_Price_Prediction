## Features

- Predict insurance charges using:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - BMI
  - Number of children
  - Smoker status
  - Region
- Clean and responsive frontend UI built with **React**
- Fast, efficient backend API using **FastAPI**
- Trained machine learning model using **scikit-learn**
- Hosted on **Render**

## Machine Learning Model

The backend uses a machine learning model trained on the popular [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset. The model pipeline includes:

- **Preprocessing**:
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Standard scaling for numerical variables
- **Model**:
  - `RandomForestRegressor` with hyperparameter tuning

The pipeline is serialized using `joblib` and loaded in the FastAPI server for real-time predictions.
